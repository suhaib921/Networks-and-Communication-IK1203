# IK1203 - Networks and Communication

The course is an introduction to networking, protocols and communication.

We study how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. We use the Internet as or working example of such a network. The course aims to give insights into both the theory and practice of the area.

The focus of the course is on the use of protocols and algorithms, particularly their application and integration within the TCP/IP stack, which forms the Internet's foundation.

## Course Content and Learning Outcomes

- **Flow and Error Management**: Techniques for flow control such as stop-and-wait and sliding window, alongside mechanisms for error detection, correction, and retransmission (Automatic Repeat reQuest - ARQ).
- **Network Layering Concepts**: An examination of the OSI and TCP/IP models, understanding their layered architectures.
- **Local Area Networks (LAN)**: Study of LAN topologies, access methods, and protocols including token ring and Ethernet, as well as wireless networks, bridged and VLAN networks, with an emphasis on spanning tree computation.
- **Switching Techniques**: Differentiating between packet and circuit switching in the context of Wide Area Networks (WAN) and public network infrastructures, including their principles, characteristics, and protocols.
- **The Internet and Internetworking**: Principles of Internet design, connection-oriented vs. connectionless protocols, IP routing, and the Internet Protocol suite.
- **Transport Layer Protocols**: In-depth look at TCP and UDP, understanding their roles in the transport layer.
- **Communication Models**: Exploration of client-server and peer-to-peer communication paradigms.
- **Network Applications**: Overview of various network applications such as DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, and Telnet, among others.
- **Network Programming**: Introduction to programming within the network context.
